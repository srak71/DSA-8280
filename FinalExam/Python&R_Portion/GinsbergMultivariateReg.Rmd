# 4. Interpreting Results

# A. Describing the effect and significance level of each 
#    Independent Variable

# Simplicity

#   - Effect: Our model finds a coef (effect) of 0.37953. 
#   This tells us we expect to see a 0.37953 unit increase in 
#   our Depression value with a one unit increase in Simplicity, 
#   given Fatalism remains constant.

#   - Significance level: Our model gives a p-value (significance level)
#    of 0.000312. Since this is less than 0.05, Simplicity has a 
#    statistically significant effect on Depression.

# Fatalism

#   - Effect: Our model finds a coef (effect) of 0.41777. This tells us
#    we expect to see a 0.41777 unit increase in our Depression value with 
#    a one unit increase in Fatalism, given Simplicity remains constant.

#   - Significance level: Our model gives a p-value (significance level) 
#    of 8.28e-05. Since this is less than 0.05, Fatalism has a statistically
#    significant effect on Depression.


# B. Interpretation of R-squared

#   - Our model gives Multiple R-squared = 0.5188, meaning 51.8% of the 
#   variation in Depression can be explained by our independent vars Simplicity 
#   and Fatalism. This score also signifies our model is a moderate fit and proves 
#   to be useful however, still has significant room for improvement.
